TransData.txt file contains the actual user test data 
embedded amongst notes regarding what case they are testing.

All NON-data lines start with % in the first column (i.e.,
the 1-character transCode returned by uiInput.getTransCode).

So the big SWITCH statement in userApp should watch
for the '%' case and just do nothing more with that pseudo-
transaction, as oppsed to 'I', 'D', 'S', 'A' cases which
call appropriate getter methods in UIinput class and
call appropriate handler methods in DataStorage class.
